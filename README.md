# HR-Data-Dashboard-Tableau
An exploration of Tableau dashboarding capabilities and analyzing race, turnover/employee retention, satisfaction, and more.

Disclaimer: the data is from here and is not real. I did not have access to HR data, and if I did, I probably wouldn't be able to publish it.

This was created in Tableau Public. The published file is on my Tableau profile here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/riley.predum#!/

The workbook can be downloaded from there for you to play around with it.

# Python and other projects
Check out my Medium articles in Towards Data Science where I walk through my projects and explain my thought processes: https://towardsdatascience.com/search?q=Riley%20Predum 

The story for this project is coming soon!
